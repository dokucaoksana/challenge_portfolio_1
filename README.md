# Task 1: software configuration. #
### Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?
1. I had an experience in manual testing at my previous job and I really enjoy that process, but repeating all of these steps can cost a lot of time and effort. 
2. I want to have the ability to reduce the time to run tests and get new knowledge, of course. 
3. I believe that project can help me with my goal.
